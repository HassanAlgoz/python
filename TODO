# TODO

- 02_numbers: needs review
- 04_functions:
    - shouldn't use greeting.upper() because they don't know what strings are yet
    - `docstring` written before being introduced

- Final review
    - ensure fasih Arabic
    - ensure consistent use of terms (and translations)
    - add visuals
    - illustrate with more examples (and use-cases)

## Order

- [x] files
- [x] serialization (save/load file formats into/from objects/datastructures)
- [x] errors
- [ ] modules

## Interaction

What?: write objectives for each lesson. And make exercises on them immediately after the lesson.
How?:
- Embed quiz pages (Google forms works)
- GitHub Classroom: You can automatically provide feedback on code submissions from your students by configuring tests to run in the assignment repository.
    - However, this needs explanation (make a Video on it)
    - Resources: https://elzero.org/problem-solving-websites/ and hackerrank: https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits/one-week-preparation-kit/one-week-day-one/challenges

What?: get feedback on the book.
How?: Embed a survey form (Google forms works)
