# Personal Expenses and Income Tracker

## Create a Python program that helps users track their personal expenses and income. The program will allow users to input their transactions, categorize them, view their spending trends, and generate basic reports.

### Features:

#### 1. Expense and Income Entry

Users can input their expenses and income, including the amount, category, and date.

#### 2. Categorization

Allow users to categorize their transactions (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, salary, etc.).

#### 3. View Transactions

Users can view a list of their transactions, sorted by date or category. They can also update and delete their own transactions.

#### 4. Basic Reports

Generate basic reports such as:

-   Total expenses
-   Total income
-   Spending by category
-   Transactions in each category
-   Average transaction value by category

#### 5. Data Persistence

Save transactions to a file (JSON or CSV) for future reference, allowing users to continue tracking their budget over time.

#### 6. Multi-User Support

Implement support for multiple users, allowing each user to have their own set of transactions and reports.
